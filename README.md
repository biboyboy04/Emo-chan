# Emo-chan: E-book Reader with Emotion Detection and Music Integration

Welcome to Emo-chan, your ultimate E-book Reader that enhances your reading experience by incorporating emotion detection and personalized music playlists. With Emo-chan, reading becomes a multisensory journey, allowing you to not only delve into captivating stories but also feel the emotions that the chapters evoke.

# Project Inspiration
We created this project because I am an avid reader who typically enjoys listening to background music while reading. This habit may be driven by a desire to reduce background noise or to enhance my focus on the reading. One day, while immersed in a book, a phenomenon occurred: the emotions conveyed by the background music perfectly connected with the scenario or chapter I was reading. It was a remarkable experience, as the music perfectly aligned with the emotions of the chapter. Instead of relying on RNG of such phenomenon, we decided to automate and increase the likelihood of this happening by creating this app.

## Features

### 1. E-book Reading

Enjoy a seamless reading experience with Emo-chan's user-friendly interface. Browse through a vast collection of E-books or upload your own to read at your leisure.


### 2. Emotion Detection AI

Emo-chan goes beyond traditional reading platforms by analyzing the emotional tone of each chapter you read. Our Emotion Detection AI model processes the text and identifies the dominant emotion, providing you with a unique insight into the emotional journey of the story.

### 3. Music Integration

To enhance your reading ambiance, Emo-chan suggests curated playlists based on the detected emotions. We utilize the Spotify API to recommend playlists that align with the emotional tone of the current chapter. Alternatively, you can customize your own playlists for different emotions, allowing you to tailor the music to your preferences.
